## Pretrain
```
bash run_train_user_ckbert_local.sh
```
This shell `run_train_user_ckbert_local.sh` will download examples for pretraining automatically and start to pretrain the model which owns the same architecture of bert. Additional, you can preprocess your own data for pretraining with the shell `preprocess/run_local_preprocess.sh`.
